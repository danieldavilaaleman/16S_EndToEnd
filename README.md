## 🔬 Overview

Ad-hoc scripting makes microbiome analyses error-prone, difficult to scale and hard to reproduce. To solve this, 16S_EndToEnd uses Snakemake to provide a fully automated and scalable workflow that processes raw 16S sequencing FASTQ files into publication-ready figures.

16S_EndToEnd performs:
- Raw read quality control and trimming using **[FASTQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/fastqc)** and **[fastp](https://github.com/opengene/fastp)**.


## 📖 What is 16S rRNA gene sequencing?
The 16S rRNA gene is highly conserved in all bacteria and archaea, making it a universal marker to identify microorganisms within a biological sample. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a widely used method to study microbial community composition and diversity.
